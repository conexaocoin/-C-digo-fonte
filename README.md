Conexão Coin - Source Code

What is Conexão coin  (COINN)?

COINN is a completely digital and decentralized currency where users manage the system without the need for intermediary or central authority. It can be transferred from one person to another via the internet or physically if it is printed as a money bill, without going through a bank or intermediary, your account cannot be frozen, you can use it in any country. There are no prerequisites or arbitrary limits. COINN allows instant and anonymous payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Coin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate without central authority: transaction management and money issuance are performed collectively across the network. Coinn is the name of open source software that allows the use of this currency.
For more information, as well as an immediately usable binary version of Coinn software, see http://coinn.com.


Conexão Coin  Platform

The Coin Connection Platform allows users to easily and simply buy and sell cryptocurrencies from any blockchain.

The platform works by accepting an investment request from a user, Oraclizing to get the current market price of encryption, calculating how much the desired amount will cost, updating the user's balance and transferring their COINN tokens to the bank or database. Bank. A user can purchase a single encryption, an index encryption fund or even reverse crypts.

Index funds simply refer to buying multiple crypts at the same time. Currently, they are not stored separately from individually purchased cryptographic balances because of gas concerns. The front end will show your investment as an index fund when you see a past event showing that you bought a cipher suite at the same time. You can sell purchased crypts on an index fund individually.

Reverse encryption refers to a token that represents the reverse price of a given encryption. For example, if ETH is currently trading at a price of $ 500, the reverse ETH is trading at a price of 1 / ETH or $ 0.002. This means that if the price of ETH falls by half, the reverse ETH doubles, effectively mimicking a short position.

All platform funds are stored in COINN and never transfer any other token: they are simply kept as balance in the UserData contract.


How to use ?

The most likely scenario in which a user will interact with these contracts is through the Coinvest front end. In this case, all these steps will be performed without the user having to interact with any smart contracts. A user can still, however, interact directly with contracts if desired. The way an investment works is as follows:

If approveAndCall is not being used, you must first approve the contract to spend the account COINN. To do this, you will call the "approve" function in the Coinvest token contract with the investment contract as a spender and the desired amount of COINN to be invested as value.

Upon approval of the investment contract to spend the user's COINN, the user will call the "buy" or "sell" function in the investment contract. In this role, they will enter a list of the encrypted asset IDs to invest in and the values (with 10 ** 18 decimal places) they would like to invest in. The investment agreement then Oraclizes at the current market price of encryption and, upon return, will update the UserData agreement and will receive or give the user COINN.

(If approveAndCall or approveAndCallPreSigned is being used, the approval and investment call can be made at the same time.)

User balances can be verified by calling the returnHoldings function in UserData. Since there is a possibility of having a large number of encryption, we allow the beginning and end of the crypt matrix to be returned. This can also be just encryption (7,7).
Security and upgradeability
To maintain the benefits of decentralization, we should not allow ourselves to have complete control over these contracts. At this time, we are able to modularize upgradeability, having functions in each contract that can be used to change the address of a contract with which it communicates, allowing you to post a new contract and update this address in other contracts.

Functions for modifying these addresses can only be called by a contract owner, but this gives the owner full control of the system. We will likely update the use of a DAO in the near future to mitigate the dangers of centralized ownership.

Tokens

The COINN token is based on the ERC20 proposal, allowing users to pay for gas using tokens instead of ether. This works when a user signs a transaction hash with all the desired data and then any delegate passes the parameters and the hash signed to the network for a transaction to be made.

were used as unique identifiers to block potential replay attacks on pre-signed transactions. The problem with this design was that it was vulnerable to the malleability of transactions. Although the malleability of the transactions was fixed for transactions on the Ethereum network, restricting signatures to the lower half of the EC, it was not fixed on the pre-compiled screen contract, thus allowing a signature to be reproduced using its counterpart.

To correct this problem, COINN now hashes the pre-signed transaction as a unique identifier. This method ensures that once a transaction is submitted, it can never be resubmitted (of course, unless a new nonce be used).

Is Conexão coin  useful for illegal activities?

Coin connection is money, and money has always been used for both legal and illegal purposes. Money, credit cards, and current banking systems far surpass any method in terms of their use to finance crimes. COINNl can bring significant innovation in payment systems and the benefits of this innovation are often considered far beyond its potential disadvantages. COINN is a huge step forward in making safer money and could also act as a significant protection against many forms of financial crime. For example, COINNs are completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are in full control of their payments and cannot receive unapproved charges such as credit card fraud. COINN transactions are irreversible and immune to fraudulent charges. Some questions have been raised that COINN could be more attractive to criminals because it can be used to make private and irreversible payments. However, these features already exist with cash and bank transfer which are widely used and well established. The use of COINN is undoubtedly subject to regulations similar to those already in force within existing financial systems and COINN is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. It is often common for important findings to be perceived as doubtful before their benefits are well understood. The Internet is a good example among many others to illustrate this.

Conexão Coin  be Regulated?

It is possible to regulate the use of COINN similar to any other instrument. Just like the real, COINN can be used for a variety of purposes, some of these may be considered legitimate or not, according to the law of each jurisdiction. In this sense, COINN is no different from any other tool or resource and may be subject to different regulations in each country. The use of COINN may be hampered by restrictive regulations. The challenge for regulators is usually to develop efficient solutions so the growth of emerging markets and businesses develops naturally.
What determines the price of Coin Connection?
Batches will initially determine the value of COINN. After all lots are traded, the price of one COINNl will be determined by the law of supply and demand. There are only a limited number of COINNs in circulation, but when 20 lots are traded, another 20 will automatically be available at ForkDelta, which is the official currency exchange for the release. The valuation perspective will lead COINN to a constant progressive appreciation. Studies indicate that it took Bitcoin a decade to overvalue because users had no prospect of potential, even causing many users to spend thousands of bitcoins even before considerable appreciation. And by combining the power of today's communication with a clear prospect of appreciation, COINN is unimaginably likely to advance to hundreds of lots in a matter of months.
What will the distribution of Coin Connection look like?
You can find currency exchange COINN, retailers, among other options, but lots will be distributed at ForkDelta currency exchange, for every 20 lots traded, another 20 will automatically be available.

Why does Conexão Coin  have value?

Coin connection have value because they are useful as a form of money. COINN has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility and recognition) based on the properties of mathematics, rather than relying on physical properties (such as gold and silver) or reliance on central authorities (such as currencies). trustees). In short, COINN is supported by math. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to maintain value is trust and adoption. In the case of COINN, this can be measured by its growing user base. As with all currencies, the value of COINN comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as payment.


What about consumer protection?

COINN is freeing people to trade on their own terms. Each user can send and receive payments similar to cash. Unlike cash and other payment methods, COINN always leaves public proof that the transaction has occurred, which can potentially be used in an appeal against companies with fraudulent practices. The way COINN works allows individuals and businesses to protect themselves against chargeback.

Test

Testing and code review is the development bottleneck, we get more pull requests than we can review and test in a short time. Please be patient and help by testing other people's pull requests, and keep in mind that this is a safety critical project where any mistake can cost people a lot of money.
