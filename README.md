Development process

The master must be stable. Development is usually done in separate branches. Tags are created to indicate stable new official versions of the coin connection.

Contribution workflow is described in CONTRIBUTING.md.

test

Testing and code review is the development bottleneck; We received more pull requests than we can review and test in a short time. Be patient and help by testing other people's requests, and keep in mind that this is a safety-critical project where any mistake can cost a lot of people money.

Automated testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for the new code and submit new unit tests for the old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they have not been disabled in configure) with: make check. Additional details on running and extending unit tests.

Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Test

Changes should be tested by someone other than the developer who wrote the code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing changes is not straightforward.

Translations

Changes to translations and new translations can be sent to the coin connection page.
